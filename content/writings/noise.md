Reach, gasp, don't get dragged below.<br>
Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.<br>
No calm or pause to be found,<br>
in this never ending torrent,<br>
in this storm of sound.

And round 'n round, up 'n down,<br>
tossed and turned,<br>
unable to find,<br>
peace nor mind,<br>
in this siege,<br>
of cognitive space,<br>
starved of time,<br>
a forgotten reprieve,<br>
a silenced place.
