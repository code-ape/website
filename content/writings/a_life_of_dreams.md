Oceans suspended. <br>
Forever in churning motion. <br>
Captive to my many moons
drifting through space. <br>
A luminious army, making light of night. <br>
Forever cycling the sky; <br>
forever denying yesterday; <br>
unlike the lines on my face. <br>

But tonight is different. <br>
Tonight is a life of dreams. <br>
No moons, no tide. <br>
Engulfed in tranquil darkness; <br>
I watch a miracle of dance; <br>
by diamonds of light. <br>
Perfectly uncountable; <br>
they shine, divinely fierce. <br>
They are of what was. <br>
Each born in a breath. <br>
Some dim, others bright. <br>
They come from us. <br>
And each of us, from them. <br>

A child of stardust; <br>
home in this labryinth of horizons; <br>
I wander through the beach of memories; <br>
guided by footprints in the stars. <br>
And in this night, rooted in the sky, I hear them. <br>
The constellations, chanting in melodies of echoes. <br>
Familiar as they are foreign. <br>
I listen, reminding the stars of who we are.
