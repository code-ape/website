## Abstract

*The global climate emergency may have taken a back seat in recent months, but it remains the biggest challenge to face the industry and humanity as a whole. Sustainability in the data center industry goes beyond just sourcing renewable power, it starts at the source of every component involved in the build. So how do you ensure that supply chain accountability and the needs of the climate are the cornerstone of hyperscale design and build?*

*At the top of the food chain, sustainability is now the key driver of innovation whilst lower down, some are still convinced that the more environment-friendly they become, the more the effort will erode their competitiveness. We ask our panel of experts to challenge the belief that sustainability will add to costs and will not deliver immediate financial benefits.*
