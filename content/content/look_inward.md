Look inwards, and find what always was but has been forgotten since.

Look inwards, and find what we were meant to look for.

Look inwards, gaze and lift your eyes.

Past the clamor, the noise, the strobing pulse of the devoid.

Look inwards, feel and move with, not through, time.

Within the rhythm dance, syncopate; soul, body, mind.

Look inwards, smell and wonder at aroma's memories.

The touch of simple days and entangled nights.

Look inwards, taste and witness life's flavours.

Uniting; sweet, savory; comforting, complex; foreign, familiar.

Look inwards, listen and know what it is to be heard.

Time is the home of echos, tuned to our stories chord.

Look inwards, sense our humanity, find life in perspective.
