Reach, gasp, don't get dragged below.  
Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.  
No calm or pause to be found,  
in this never ending torrent,  
in this storm of sound.

And round 'n round, up 'n down,  
tossed and turned,  
unable to find,  
peace nor mind,  
in this siege,  
of cognitive space,  
starved of time,  
a forgotten reprieve,  
a silenced place.
