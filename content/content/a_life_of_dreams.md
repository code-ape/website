Oceans suspended.  
Forever in churning motion.  
Captive to my many moons
drifting through space.  
A luminous army, making light of night.  
Forever cycling the sky;  
forever denying yesterday;  
unlike the lines on my face.  

But tonight is different.  
Tonight is a life of dreams.  
No moons, no tide.  
Engulfed in tranquil darkness;  
I watch a miracle of dance;  
by diamonds of light.  
Perfectly uncountable;  
they shine, divinely fierce.  
They are of what was.  
Each born in a breath.  
Some dim, others bright.  
They come from us.  
And each of us, from them.  

A child of stardust;  
home in this labyrinth of horizons;  
I wander through the beach of memories;  
guided by footprints in the stars.  
And in this night, rooted in the sky, I hear them.  
The constellations, chanting in melodies of echoes.  
Familiar as they are foreign.  
I listen, reminding the stars of who we are.
