# This website

The world is full of questions, or it is to me at least.
I've made this website to share my occasional thoughts on some of the questions I ponder.
Many of my writings on this site are about software and technology, but many also are not.
To me software has no meaning without the people who use it.
And in a way, that is what the thoughts on this website are really devoted to: humanity.
I've only recently started this site but over time it will likely hold thoughts on software, ethics, economics, food, literature, travel, and many other topics.
I hope that whoever finds them many use them to make their life, and the world, a bit better.

Cheers,<br>
Ferris


# Myself

Professionally, I could be catagoized as a software engineer.
But practically, I would simply say I think really hard about difficult problems. 
Some of my past personal projects include conceiving TEDxEHC and being one of the head organizers for its first event in 2016.

If you're looking for more information about me please contact me as described below.
Otherwise, it is my preference to express myself through my work rather than an oddly written self description via a third person soliloquy.

If you wish to reach me for professional reasons, such as requesting me to speak at events or for a copy of my CV,  please refer to the contact section below.


# Contact

I can be reached at [info@ferrisellis.com](mailto:info@ferrisellis.com) or, more casually, via Twitter ([@im_ferris](https://twitter.com/im_ferris)).
