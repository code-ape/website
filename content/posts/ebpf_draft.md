# eBPF, part 2 of 3 [TODO, update for part 2]

This article is the second in a three part series on eBPF.
Each will build on the prior ones and progress from concepts and explanations towards examples and implementations.
This will culminate in the last article which involves building a basic driver for eBPF in Rust.
This first article will explore the eBPF's history, current state, and future trajectory.
In doing so I hope to make the current state and functions of eBPF, along with its siblings, more coherent.
As with many software projects, eBPF can appear odd and spastic in form without the context of the history which shaped it.

# eBPF

The difficulty of explaining and using eBPF stems from how different it is from anything the general methods of network operations.

It is a new, fundamentally different abstraction of networking.
It is built into the Linux kernel and subsequently approaches networking the way one might imagine a kernel developer would.
