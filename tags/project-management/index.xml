      <description>This article is written in present tense and first person to provide a more engaging narrative to the reader. However, all statements and claims are made with the time reference to when this was published. Thus &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; is May 16, 2017.
Special thanks to my colleague Gary Berger for providing feedback on this article.
Intro Project management, leadership, working remotely, team organization, and client relationship management are all topics which have been written about, at length.</description>
