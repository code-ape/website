Oceans suspended. Forever in churning motion. Captive to my many moons drifting through space. A luminious army, making light of night. Forever cycling the sky; forever denying yesterday; unlike the lines on my face. But tonight is different. Tonight is a life of dreams. No moons, no tide. Engulfed in tranquil darkness; I watch a miracle of dance; by diamonds of light.</description>

Like many Americans, I have the habit of setting New Year resolutions. It’s a pretty simple process. Step one, think about how you want your life to be different. Step two, declare it as a goal to accomplish in the next 365 days. Step three, forget about most — if not all — of your goals until the next round of New Year resolutions.</description>

There’s more to society than rural and urban; than buildings and pavement; than a place’s “development”. There are qualities more important. There is culture, art, and food; music, sunrises, and naps under shady trees; bustling markets, quiet views, and familiar paths; communities, friends, and family.
These are unique to each place. They are its holistic quality; what form our memories of it; what each uniquely excels at.</description>

Some days are the Other Days. The days that aren’t really days, because a day must exist as a whole. On such days, the Other Days, I find myself looking at it. Not throughout the Other Days, as they aren’t really days. In fact it is because of this that they aren’t days. These hour long moments of looking at it, or rather, looking into it.</description>

A rainless space among a storm, What you&amp;rsquo;ll wish for when the sun is too warm, A fact of a forrest, or the few we have left, Beneath it naps are aften slept.</description>

Reach, gasp, don&amp;rsquo;t get dragged below.
Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.
No calm or pause to be found,
in this never ending torrent,
in this storm of sound.
And round &amp;lsquo;n round, up &amp;lsquo;n down,
tossed and turned,
unable to find,
peace nor mind,
in this siege,
of cognitive space,
starved of time,
a forgotten reprieve,
a silenced place.</description>

      <description>The following document is versioned as alpha v1 by it&amp;rsquo;s own definition of such terms. If you are interested in contributing please either submit an issue to the repository for this blog or email me as detailed on the contact section of the about page.
Introduction In the world of software projects, code lives a lifecycle. It is developed, released, packaged, used, and finally decommissioned1; often to be replaced by a successor from the same project.</description>

Look inwards, and find what always was but has been forgotten since.
Look inwards, and find what we were meant to look for.
Look inwards, gaze and lift your eyes.
Past the clamor, the noise, the strobing pulse of the devoid.
Look inwards, feel and move with, not through, time.
Within the rhythm dance, syncopate; soul, body, mind.
Look inwards, smell and wonder at aroma&amp;rsquo;s memories.</description>

      <title>Strength in Numbers: Unums and the Quest for Reliable Arithmatic</title>

      <description>A talk by Ferris Ellis at Strange Loop 2017.
Abstract In the land of computer arithmetic, a tyrant has ruled since its very beginning: the floating point number. Under its rule we have all endured countless hardships and cruelties. To this very day the floating point number still denies 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 and returns insidious infinities to software developers everywhere. But a new hero has entered fray: the universal number (unum).</description>

      <description>This article is written in present tense and first person to provide a more engaging narrative to the reader. However, all statements and claims are made with the time reference to when this was published. Thus &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; is May 16, 2017.
Special thanks to my colleague Gary Berger for providing feedback on this article.
Intro Project management, leadership, working remotely, team organization, and client relationship management are all topics which have been written about, at length.</description>

      <title>eBPF, part 2: Syscall and Map Types</title>
      <link>https://ferrisellis.com/posts/ebpf_syscall_and_maps/</link>

      <description>eBPF, part 2 This article is the second in a series on eBPF. It builds upon the previous article, &amp;ldquo;eBPF, part 1: Past, Present, and Future&amp;rdquo;, by diving into the core of using eBPF: the Linux bpf syscall. In doing so this article hopes to offer a completely fleshed out depiction of the core machinery one must use for utilizing eBPF.
This article also references future articles that will be written for this series.</description>

      <description>eBPF, part 1 This article is the first in a series on eBPF. Each will build on the prior ones and progress from concepts and context towards examples and implementations. This first article will explore eBPF&amp;rsquo;s history, current state, and future trajectory. In doing so I hope to make the current state and function of eBPF more coherent. As with many software projects, eBPF can appear odd and spastic without the context of the history which shaped it.</description>

      <title>Math with distances in Rust: safety and correctness across units</title>
      <link>https://ferrisellis.com/posts/rust-implementing-units-for-types/</link>

      <description>Recently Jasper Schulz wrote an excellent short article titled Communicating Intent. In it he walks through using the newtype-pattern in combination with the From and Into traits for the purpose of allowing the compiler to do all datatype checking and transformation.
The reason things like this are useful is, as shown by Schulz in the article, you can write code which allows type conversions without knowing what your converting from.</description>
