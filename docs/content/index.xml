Abstract The global climate emergency may have taken a back seat in recent months, but it remains the biggest challenge to face the industry and humanity as a whole.</description>

Oceans suspended.
Forever in churning motion.
Captive to my many moons drifting through space.
A luminous army, making light of night.
Forever cycling the sky;
forever denying yesterday;
unlike the lines on my face.
But tonight is different.
Tonight is a life of dreams.
No moons, no tide.
Engulfed in tranquil darkness;
I watch a miracle of dance;
by diamonds of light.</description>

Like many Americans, I have the habit of setting New Year resolutions. It’s a pretty simple process. Step one, think about how you want your life to be different. Step two, declare it as a goal to accomplish in the next 365 days. Step three, forget about most — if not all — of your goals until the next round of New Year resolutions.</description>

There’s more to society than rural and urban; than buildings and pavement; than a place’s “development”. There are qualities more important. There is culture, art, and food; music, sunrises, and naps under shady trees; bustling markets, quiet views, and familiar paths; communities, friends, and family.
These are unique to each place. They are its holistic quality; what form our memories of it; what each uniquely excels at.</description>

Some days are the Other Days. The days that aren’t really days, because a day must exist as a whole. On such days, the Other Days, I find myself looking at it. Not throughout the Other Days, as they aren’t really days. In fact it is because of this that they aren’t days. These hour long moments of looking at it, or rather, looking into it.</description>

A rainless space among a storm,
What you&amp;rsquo;ll wish for when the sun is too warm,
A fact of a forrest, or the few we have left,
Beneath it naps are aften slept.</description>

Reach, gasp, don&amp;rsquo;t get dragged below.
Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.
No calm or pause to be found,
in this never ending torrent,
in this storm of sound.
And round &amp;lsquo;n round, up &amp;lsquo;n down,
tossed and turned,
unable to find,
peace nor mind,
in this siege,
of cognitive space,
starved of time,
a forgotten reprieve,
a silenced place.</description>

Look inwards, and find what always was but has been forgotten since.
Look inwards, and find what we were meant to look for.
Look inwards, gaze and lift your eyes.
Past the clamor, the noise, the strobing pulse of the devoid.
Look inwards, feel and move with, not through, time.
Within the rhythm dance, syncopate; soul, body, mind.
Look inwards, smell and wonder at aroma&amp;rsquo;s memories.</description>

      <title>Strength in Numbers: Unums and the Quest for Reliable Arithmetic</title>

      <description>A talk by Ferris Ellis at Strange Loop 2017.
Abstract In the land of computer arithmetic, a tyrant has ruled since its very beginning: the floating point number. Under its rule we have all endured countless hardships and cruelties. To this very day the floating point number still denies 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 and returns insidious infinities to software developers everywhere. But a new hero has entered fray: the universal number (unum).</description>

      <description>Remotely running a project with a distributed team can be challenging.
When that team is mostly from the client who you&amp;rsquo;re doing said project for, it can increase those challenges.
This article shares a few niche lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from being in such a position.</description>

      <title>eBPF, part 2: Syscall and Map Types</title>
      <link>https://www.ferrisellis.com/content/ebpf_syscall_and_maps/</link>

      <description>Due to the its fast adoption, using eBPF is different for each system it has been integrated with.
However, the common denominator for all uses is the syscall for eBPF.
This syscall, the &lt;code&gt;bpf&lt;/code&gt; syscall in Linux, allows eBPF programs to be loaded into the kernel and eBPF-maps to be created and manipulated.
As the second installment in the eBPF series, this article works through all the commands of the syscall plus the different eBPF-map types, since they are controlled through the syscall.</description>

      <title>eBPF, part 1: Past, Present, and Future</title>
      <link>https://www.ferrisellis.com/content/ebpf_past_present_future/</link>

      <description>The Extended Berkeley Packet Filter, or eBPF, has rapidly been adopted into a number of Linux kernel systems since its introduction into the Linux kernel in late 2014.
Understanding eBPF, however, can be difficult as many try to explain it via a use of eBPF as opposed to its design.
Indeed eBPF&amp;rsquo;s name indicates that it is for packet filtering even though it now has uses which have nothing to do with networking.
This article will walk through eBPF&amp;rsquo;s past, present, and future to offer context on how eBPF came to be what it is and what it is likely to become as development on it continues.</description>

      <title>Math with distances in Rust: safety and correctness across units</title>
      <link>https://www.ferrisellis.com/content/rust-implementing-units-for-types/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ferrisellis.com/content/rust-implementing-units-for-types/</guid>
      <description>Computers weren&amp;rsquo;t designed to have outside concepts, such as units of length, expressed in their function.
Because of this Rust, being a systems language, also has no concept of it.
But just because the computer runtime has no concept of length or units of length doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we can&amp;rsquo;t teach them to the compiler.
In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through using a generic struct to represent the concept of a length, extend that length to allow any units, and show how to create a system to cleanly and safely do arithmetic with lengths.</description>
