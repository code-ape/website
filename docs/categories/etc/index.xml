Oceans suspended. Forever in churning motion. Captive to my many moons drifting through space. A luminous army, making light of night. Forever cycling the sky; forever denying yesterday; unlike the lines on my face. But tonight is different. Tonight is a life of dreams. No moons, no tide. Engulfed in tranquil darkness; I watch a miracle of dance; by diamonds of light.</description>

Some days are the Other Days. The days that aren’t really days, because a day must exist as a whole. On such days, the Other Days, I find myself looking at it. Not throughout the Other Days, as they aren’t really days. In fact it is because of this that they aren’t days. These hour long moments of looking at it, or rather, looking into it.</description>

A rainless space among a storm, What you&amp;rsquo;ll wish for when the sun is too warm, A fact of a forrest, or the few we have left, Beneath it naps are aften slept.</description>

Reach, gasp, don&amp;rsquo;t get dragged below.
Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.
No calm or pause to be found,
in this never ending torrent,
in this storm of sound.
And round &amp;lsquo;n round, up &amp;lsquo;n down,
tossed and turned,
unable to find,
peace nor mind,
in this siege,
of cognitive space,
starved of time,
a forgotten reprieve,
a silenced place.</description>

      <title>Look Inwards</title>

Look inwards, and find what always was but has been forgotten since.
Look inwards, and find what we were meant to look for.
Look inwards, gaze and lift your eyes.
Past the clamor, the noise, the strobing pulse of the devoid.
Look inwards, feel and move with, not through, time.
Within the rhythm dance, syncopate; soul, body, mind.
Look inwards, smell and wonder at aroma&amp;rsquo;s memories.</description>
