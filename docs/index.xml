There’s more to society than rural and urban; than buildings and pavement; than a place’s “development”. There are qualities more important. There is culture, art, and food; music, sunrises, and naps under shady trees; bustling markets, quiet views, and familiar paths; communities, friends, and family.
These are unique to each place. They are its holistic quality; what form our memories of it; what each uniquely excels at.]]></description>

Minute by minute, fight the constant tow.
No calm or pause to be found,

tossed and turned,
unable to find,

To this very day the floating point number still denies 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 and returns insidious infinities to software developers everywhere.

Understanding eBPF, however, can be difficult as many try to explain it via a use of eBPF as opposed to its design.
Indeed eBPF&rsquo;s name indicates that it is for packet filtering even though it now has uses which have nothing to do with networking.
This article will walk through eBPF&rsquo;s past, present, and future to offer context on how eBPF came to be what it is and what it is likely to become as development on it continues.]]></description>
