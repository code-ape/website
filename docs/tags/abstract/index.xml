Some days are the Other Days. The days that aren’t really days, because a day must exist as a whole. On such days, the Other Days, I find myself looking at it. Not throughout the Other Days, as they aren’t really days. In fact it is because of this that they aren’t days. These hour long moments of looking at it, or rather, looking into it.</description>
