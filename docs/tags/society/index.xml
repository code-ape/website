Like many Americans, I have the habit of setting New Year resolutions. It’s a pretty simple process. Step one, think about how you want your life to be different. Step two, declare it as a goal to accomplish in the next 365 days. Step three, forget about most — if not all — of your goals until the next round of New Year resolutions.</description>

There’s more to society than rural and urban; than buildings and pavement; than a place’s “development”. There are qualities more important. There is culture, art, and food; music, sunrises, and naps under shady trees; bustling markets, quiet views, and familiar paths; communities, friends, and family.
These are unique to each place. They are its holistic quality; what form our memories of it; what each uniquely excels at.</description>
