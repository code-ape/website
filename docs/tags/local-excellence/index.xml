There’s more to society than rural and urban; than buildings and pavement; than a place’s “development”. There are qualities more important. There is culture, art, and food; music, sunrises, and naps under shady trees; bustling markets, quiet views, and familiar paths; communities, friends, and family.
These are unique to each place. They are its holistic quality; what form our memories of it; what each uniquely excels at.</description>
